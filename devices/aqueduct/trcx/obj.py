        For each of the 12 pump inputs, pass a :class:`PumpCommand`, a dictionary (specified keys below), or None.

        If a :class:`PumpCommand` is passed, the command must have valid `mode`, `direction`, `rate_value`,
        and `rate_units` members. If `mode` is set to `finite`, the command must have valid `finite_units` and
        `finite_value` members.

        Here's an example of starting pump inputs 0 and 2 in continuous
        infuse mode at a rate of 1 mL/min. Note the use of the :class:`TRCX` class constants
        for mode, direction, and rate_units. Since no parameters are passed to
        inputs 1 and 3-11, no action is taken for those pumps. Since the mode of operation
        for both input 0 and 2 is non-blocking, the Recipe will resume execution after
        confirmation of successful communication.

        :Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            command = TRCXSIM.make_command(mode = TRCXSIM.continuous, direction = TRCXSIM.infuse,

            TRCXSIM.pump(pump0=command, pump2=command)


        Here's another example of starting a single pump input, 1, in finite mode in the
        withdraw direction. Since the mode of operation here is `finite`, the Recipe
        will be blocked from continuing until the pump has withdrawn the assigned amount.
        To prevent blocking, set `wait_for_complete` to False.

        :Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            command = TRCXSIM.make_command(mode = TRCXSIM.finite, direction = TRCXSIM.withdraw,
                                           rate_value = 1.0, rate_units = TRCXSIM.ml_min,

            TRCXSIM.pump(pump1=command)
