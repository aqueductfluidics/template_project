"""
Usage - Copy this template when creating a new Recipe
protocol.

In DEV MODE, the template creates an
Aqueduct Object (with Prompt, Input, etc.. helpers),
Device Objects.

IN LAB MODE or SIM MODE (run through the Aqueduct Recipe
Runner), the Aqueduct and Device Objects are inherited
from the Python interpreters Globals() dict

The Data, Setpoints, Watchdog, and Process Objects are constructed
using the appropriate Aqueduct and Devices objects.
